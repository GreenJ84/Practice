// For this challenge, we will look not only at the entire string, but also substrings within it.
// For a string, return the longest palindromic substring. Given ​"what up, dada?"​, return "dad"​. Given ​"not much"​, return ​"n"​. ​Include spaces​ as well (i.e. be strict, as in the “Is Palindrome” challenge): given ​"My favorite racecar erupted!"​, return ​"e racecar e"​.
